## Quick start
This mobile app made with **Flutter v3.10.6**. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/).
